It's introducing watchOS 4, a big update that overhauls both the look and several key features -- including the watch face itself. To start, there's a new Siri-powered watch face that automatically displays updates based on context. You'll get traffic alerts if you're about to head out to work, for example. There are also kaleidoscope and Toy Story faces if you're feeling particularly trippy or youthful. Fitness also gets a big push this time around. The Activity app introduces monthly challenges while the Workout app has a simpler Quick Start feature and automatic sets for pool swims. If you're a fan of high-intensity interval workouts, you'll get custom heart rate algorithms. Use connected gym equipment? There's now two-way data transfers to make sure your info is consistent among devices from the likes of Schwinn and StairMaster. And if you're the sort who can't start a run without some music, you can pick a playlist that automatically starts alongside your routine. There are plenty of tweaks elsewhere. Apple has reworked the dock with an easier-to-use vertical layout, while the Music app is getting an overhaul with a more visual layout and automatic background syncing. Hardware compatibility will be more robust too, thanks to support for Core Bluetooth devices. Your glucose monitor could easily pair to your Apple Watch, for instance. WatchOS 4 is slated to ship in the fall as a free update. It's not quite the big makeover you saw with watchOS 3, but that's not surprising. Last year's upgrade was about addressing fundamental interface problems: Now it's more a matter of refining the experience."}	\N

As usual, senior VP of software engineering Craig Federighi is onstage detailing the latest features that Apple will bring to macOS High Sierra when it launches. (I swear that's the real name.) The first update is for Safari, with Federighi claiming that Safari tops all desktop browsers in speed: He even went as far as to say it's the world's fastest desktop browser. A Modern Javascript test claims the new Safari is 80 percent faster than Chrome. The browser also features autoplay blocking: It detects sites that shouldn't be playing video and pauses them. Safari also will deal with the various trackers that follow us around the internet with a feature called Intelligent Tracking Prevention. It uses machine learning to look for cross-site trackers and \\"segregates\\" them so that they can't keep tracking you. Anyone who is concerned with their privacy will likely want to check this out. Photos got a big update last year, but Apple's dropping more improvements in High Sierra. There's now a persistent sidebar (like iPhoto had for years before Apple took it away), and when you set up People to group various people you photograph, it'll sync from your desktop to other devices. Perhaps the biggest deal is that you can pop a photo out from the Photos app into a more robust editor like Photoshop and then sync the changes right back to your Photos library. Naturally, Mail got a few updates as well. Spotlight search results have been improved, with some \\"top hits\\" showing up. There's also a split-view compose window that keeps the message you're replying to on one side and your new mail on the other. Last, Mail is more efficient, with your mail library size set to shrink about 35 percent. There are a bunch of under-the-hood improvements in macOS Sierra as well. Most notably, Apple is now using its own Apple File System, a move that should do a lot to speed things up in the file system. It's not the kind of feature that Federighi can demo onstage, but he did show how much a few common actions would speed up. He also announced that Apple was moving to the H.265 video standard, from H.264. Apple's also pushing out a new update to its Metal graphics suite that provides developer access to the GPU. There's a lot to unpack here, but Metal 2 is well suited to machine learning and external graphics -- Apple is even offering a Thunderbolt 3 external graphics kit. Apple even started talking about VR: Metal for VR will enable developers to start building VR experiences and use the HTC Vive with the Mac for the first time. Federighi absolutely slammed through the macOS updates today, but it feels to some extent like an update that is all about refinement rather than major new consumer-facing features. But this isn't the only update for Mac fans today: Apple has also already announced a major update to the iMac line, and it feels like more hardware may be coming soon. Apple said that High Sierra would run on every Mac that is able to run macOS Sierra, and it'll be out this fall, as always. Last year's update, macOS Sierra, continued the trend of Apple bringing a number of tools from iOS over to the Mac. Most notable was Siri appearing on your desktop, but other useful features included a universal copy and paste between iOS and the Mac, storage optimization using iCloud, Apple Pay in Safari, and big redesigns to Photos, Apple Music and Messages."}	\N

Earlier this year, Phil Schiller, Apple's SVP of Worldwide Marketing, promised that the company would produce iMacs specifically for the professional customer. The new iMacs are faster, with better displays, in the same enclosure. At WWDC, Apple's VP of Engineering introduced displays that are 500 nits, with 1 billion colors. That's 43 percent brighter than the previous generation. Discrete graphics are now standard on the 4K 21.5-inch. The line is also going to use Intel's Kaby Lake processors and are bumping up to 32GB of RAM on the 21.5-inch and up to 64GB on the 27-inch. The iMacs also have Thunderbolt 3, like last year's MacBook Pro. Fusion drives will be standard on the 27-inch and high-end 21.5 inch models. They also get the following: Iris Plus 640 on the 21.5-inch and Radeon Pro 555 and 560 on the 4K 21.5-inch. The 27-inch iMac gets Radeon Pro 570, 575 and 580 GPUs. There's also an emphasis on VR creation. These new iMac specs will definitely work for pros, but Apple also announced the iMac Pro, so we'll have to see how they're different from one another. The standard iMac now starts at $1,099. The 4K 21-inch drops to $1299, and the line tops out at $1,799. The iMac line was last updated in October of 2015, which included 4K and 5K displays and a redesigned mouse, keyboard and trackpad. Given the lack of an update to iMacs in 2016, some speculated that Apple was neglecting its desktops, but today's announcements should help put that grumbling to rest."}	\N

Apple claims that High Sierra is its fastest OS ever and Apple File is part of that, offering much better performance and security than before. It was first unveiled at WWDC last year, and Apple said it would arrive to all its products, from Apple TV to Watch OS to iOS. As such, many folks were expecting it to come to MacOS today at WWDC 2017. Along with the speed, APFS supports far more files than ever, letting you put 9 quintillion of them on a single volume. Security-wise, it includes multikey encryption, making it tough for bad guys (or law enforcement and spies) to crack even if they have physical access to your drive. That encryption will also work in a unified way across all of Apple's devices. At the same time, APFS is backwardly compatible with all of your HFS formatted drives. Apple File is arguably a more important update on MacOS than other devices, because a lot of creative folks lean on their Macs for disk-heavy tasks like video and photo editing. As Apple VP Craig Federighi showed on the stage, copying files now runs nearly instantly on Apple File, compared to the now-decades-old HFS filesystem. It not only offers better throughput, but faster latency -- important if you're handling lots of files. Apple says that the new advanced filesystem is \\"optimized for modern storage,\\" including fast SSDs, flash, Lightning and USB drives. It'll also easily adapt to future types of storage, the company says. The new filesystem will arrive sometime in September at Apple's usual iPhone event with the launch of MacOS High Sierra."}	\N

You can also cram in up to 4TB of SSD storage, with a row of USB ports lining up with four Thunderbolt ports. These (and all the rest of the connections: there are a few) are all found behind a 27-inch Retina 5K display, with all-flash memory architecture and all-new thermal design, adding 80 percent more cooling capacity to all that processing power.Yep, the iMac Pro is unapologetically for power users, and anyone involved with graphics editing, virtual reality and graphics work. The all-in-one is scheduled to ship in December starting at $4,999. This isn't a replacement for the Mac Pro however -- Apple says it's still working on a completely redesigned Mac Pro, for (even) higher-end computing in a modular, upgradeable design.

Messages, for instance, now syncs across all of your devices via iCloud and gains a redesigned app drawer for better discovery. Apple Pay is now capable of letting you send cash to other people via iMessage, with the payments authenticated with Touch ID. Siri, meanwhile, gets automatic translation native to its voice interface, a feature that's been sorely lacking in previous versions  Siri isn't just a voice assistant anymore, and Apple is pushing the idea that it does a similar job to Google Assistant on Android. For instance, contextual learning and predictive suggestions will be synced across all of your devices, hoping to know what you need before you do. Siri will also monitor your web browsing and attempt to find you other resources that may be relevant to your interests. Apple was, of course, quick to add that while all of this information is synced, it will all still be encrypted. The company's Craig Federigi also showed off a revamped Control Center that keeps all of your buttons constrained to a single pane. In addition, the notification pane has now been ditched in favor of the lock screen -- so an upward swipe will take you back to your lock screen. The operating system also gains HomeKit and AirPlay 2, both of which have been upgraded to include speakers, letting you control your multi-room audio system. On the photo side, your snaps are expected to get better picture quality and better low-light performance, as well as newer effects. For instance, you can select which frame in a Live Photo is the one you want to keep or publish. Oh, and using machine learning, it's possible for the photos app to automatically select perfect loops similar to Instagram's Boomerang feature. In addition, the company is adding HEVC and HEIF compression to shrink video and images down on your devices. Maps is also catching up to Google's alternative, gaining detailed internal navigation for shopping malls and airports across the globe. The driving navigation window now shows you your speed and can now offer lane guidance that can help you drive around. On the safety front, the company is adding a feature called Do Not Disturb While Driving that'll identify when you're driving and shut off the display while you're in motion. If you receive a message while in this mode, the phone will send an automatic response saying that you're driving, and will respond later. The App Store is also getting an Apple Music-esque redesign in iOS 11, with greater emphasis on discovery and better visuals. Rather than one app store, the new platform essentially breaks out Apps, Games and In-App Purchases to three separate sections. Users will also be directed toward the Today pane, that'll highlight new and popular apps to help users discover what's available. There's been a lot of talk about AR recently, and Apple's approach to the space is to build AR Kit, a platform that's baked into iOS 11. Federigi went to great pains to point out that there is no need for new hardware to support such a technology. Instead, the built-in technology in existing devices is capable of rendering AR content already, with the company showing off a live demo of Pokémon Go that looks much more realistic. On the iPad, iOS 11 gets some features that you're probably more familiar with on desktops and laptops, including using the dock to switch between apps. Simply swipe up from the bottom of the display and the dock will appear. You can even drag an app from the dock into the main work area to use side-by-side. Then there is the Files app, which lets you manage your files on the iPad in a way that's unprecedented on iOS. Given Apple's recent marketing push for the iPad Pro as a laptop replacement, it's little surprise to see the platform addressing user concerns. iOS 11 will be available as an update in the fall, presumably at the same time as the new iPhones launch."}	\N

If you receive money, it'll go on something called an Apple Pay cash card. What's not clear is whether or not you can sync that card back to a bank account. Apple will certainly have more details about Apple Pay for iMessage once its website has updated with the details on iOS 11. We do know that Apple Pay for messages will work on the Apple Watch as well the iPhone. Federighi showed a quick demo of Apple Pay in iOS11 on stage, and it's pretty basic.

The next best thing would be to plug in your desired NVIDIA card via an external enclosure, but you'd still be stuck with Windows here. Thankfully, Cupertino has finally decided to take matters into its own hands by unveiling its very own Thunderbolt 3 GPU enclosure at WWDC. This developer kit houses an AMD Radeon RX 580 which is plenty of power to run VR, and as a bonus, it also features a USB-C hub. There's no price just yet, but given that it's positioned as a dev kit, chances are it won't come cheap; but what really matters here is that macOS is finally VR-friendly, which is great news for both developers and consumers. Also announced at WWDC is macOS support for SteamVR, and HTC Vive is already confirmed to support it. Yes, you'll no longer have to dual-boot into Windows just to use the Vive on your Mac. The Oculus Rift was oddly missing throughout the keynote, but since it's SteamVR we're talking about here, it's probably just a matter of time before it gets macOS compatibility as well. At least one person is looking forward to that, anyway. For the non-developers, the 27-inch iMac Retina 5K is getting refreshed with Intel's Kaby Lake CPUs along with AMD's Radeon Pro 570, 575 and 580, which are good enough for running VR. The cost? These start from $1,799."}	\N

It's improving both the Camera and Photos apps to take some of the headaches out of snapshots and photos. For instance, the Photos app's Memories section can make use of machine learning to automatically reorient images when you change your phone's orientation -- it knows what to focus on. Live Photos also make use of this AI-like technology for effects. And Live Photos should be decidedly liverly with new visual tricks, including a long exposure blur effect, the ability to pick a key photo, video looping and a Boomerang-style \\"bounce\\" effect. Also, Apple is making some improvements that will help you capture more photos and videos. It's switching to HEVC (aka H.265) encoding for videos, which is twice as efficient as the H.264 format used today. For still shots, meanwhile, Apple is moving to HEIF (High Efficiency Image Format) to achieve similar space-saving. In theory, you won't have to worry quite so much about running out of storage when you're capturing every moment of your next vacation. We have questions about exporting images (how easy will it be to share JPEGs with everyone?), but this could be very helpful in a world where 4K video and large photos are becoming commonplace."}	\N

During today's keynote, the company gave us a brief rundown of a couple changes we can expect for the service. The big update wasn't video-focused though, it's primarily the ability to see what your friends are listening to inside Apple Music. Apple will show you what you're friends are listening to right in the app -- similar to what Spotify and other apps do already. In the \\"For You\\" tab inside the app, you'll see a scrolling list of what your pals are streaming. Album artwork is displayed there with tiny avatars to indicate which of your friends have been listening to that particular selection. The company also mentioned that 27 million people are subscribing to the service. That's still a few million less than Spotify's 50 million paying customers. What's more, Apple announced Apple Music API Kit to help developers integrate their apps with the streaming service. We're talking about things like Nike+ Run Club, Anchor and Shazam for now, but there are sure to be many more options in the near future. There's also multiroom audio support for a number of speaker brands coming to HomeKit through AirPlay 2. This is the second year in a row Apple revealed new features for Apple Music at WWDC. Last June, the company switched up the interface to make it easier to find the music you want quickly. That revamp also put less attention on the social features of the service that were a key focus leading up to the initial launch. A new version of iOS is a convenient time to take the wraps off new enhancements for the music streaming service as well, so we could be in for annual updates during the developer event. Apple already tipped its hand with a load of videos we can expect on the service -- a number of which are set to debut soon. A documentary on Bad Boy's hip hop legacy debuts at the end of the month while the new take on James Corden's Carpool Karaoke is scheduled to arrive in early August (after a delay). There are a number of other documentaries and series as well, and with labels pressuring Apple to offer fewer exclusive album releases, the company could leverage its video library in an attempt to lure users from the competition."}	\N

The sheer volume of apps means it's hard to get noticed, however, and on the flip-side it's difficult for users to find genuinely useful software. So Apple is finally redesigning the App Store. It has a similar look to Apple Music and News, with large, bubble-like cards displayed in a visual feed. You'll start on the Today tab, which has a curated and personalised selection of apps to browse. Swipe across and you'll hit Games, followed by (your) Apps, Updates and Search. Apple kicked off the reveal with a \\"world premiere\\" of Monument Valley 2, a successor to the M.C Escher-inspired game by UsTwo. Scrolling through each feed, it's clear that less information will be visible on your screen at any one time — Apple is banking on that being a boon, rather than a drawback, however. The company wants to avoid \\"information overload\\" by focusing on smaller, specialized app lists instead. There will be an App of the Day, a Game of the Day and even Store-specific blog posts and lists — one example Apple showed was called \\"5 Tips to Get More out of VSCO.\\" When you find an app, you'll notice that in-app purchases are now available on the same page. That means you can buy photo filters, or sign up for a monthly video streaming subscription without digging through the app itself. Description pages are also being reworked so that developers can write longer, creative notes, rather like a blogging platform. All told, it's a huge revamp for the App Store. The renewed focus on curation is intriguing — it will, in theory, improve app discovery, boosting revenue and competition. If Apple's efforts fail, however, it could exasperate the store's existing issues, making it harder than ever for developers to earn a living."}	\N

But for a lot of us, it's tough to ignore all those notifications when we should be paying attention to the road. So Apple has created a new feature for the upcoming iOS 11, Do Not Disturb While Driving. The feature does exactly what you expect, it keeps all those pesky alerts from appearing on your screen while you're behind the wheel. It uses Bluetooth or WiFi doppler effect to determine how quickly you're moving and will show you a blank screen. After you've used the feature once, it'll prompt you to launch DNDWD when it determines if you're in a moving vehicle. You can dismiss the notice by saying you're a passenger. When enabled, the feature also auto-replies to texts with a message that you're driving. There is the option to whitelist certain contacts and they'll have the option to text back \\"urgent\\" to display their text regardless if Do Not Disturb While Driving is running. The new option is Apple's way of making the iPhone more car and safety friendly when the driver doesn't have access to CarPlay. Apple also updated its Maps app with lane guidance so drivers are alerted which lane they should be in for things like exiting the freeway. The company also added detailed indoor Mall and Airport maps so you can find your gate and the nearest Sbarro."}	\N

While we're yet to see the rumored Siri speaker, the company announced today that it's expanding its smart home hub to support a large number of third-party audio hardware. Many of the brands you'd expect to be on board are, including Bang & Olufsen, Bose, Denon, Bowers & Wilkins, Libratone and, of course, Beats. However, Sonos isn't on the list, at least at the moment. If you happen to own a connected speaker made by one of Apple's listed partners, expect them to introduce new speakers that integrate with the HomeKit app, allowing you to control your multi-room setup and enjoy collaborative Apple Music playlists that you've curated with friends. The functionality comes as a result of AirPlay 2, an updated version of Apple's wireless AV technology. The company hasn't clarified if older AirPlay-enabled speakers can be updated to support the new platform -- we've contacted Apple for more information and will update you once we hear back."}	\N

Its sheer size and high-end specs made it a standout of the tablet scene, while the Apple Pencil made to work with it made it a hit with designers and other creatives. Now, just a year after Apple introduced a smaller, still capable 9.7-inch iPad Pro with a more typical form factor, the tech company has replaced it with a new, larger model: a 10.5-inch iPad Pro. This new model -- which appears to be replacing the 9.7-inch iPad Pro -- has a larger 10.5 inch display, which is 20 percent larger, with a 40 percent reduction in borders, and it weighs in at 1 pound. It has a full-size onscreen keyboard, as well as a full-sized Smart Keyboard (that Apple sells separately), with support for more than 30 languages. For the first time, there will be a Japanese-language keyboard, too. There's a True Tone display, a wide color gamut, Ultralow reflectivity and 600 nit brightness, making watching movies even better. Under the hood, the iPad Pro uses an A10X Fusion chip with a six-core CPU, which brings three high-performance cores and three high-efficiency ones. There's also a 12-core GPU on deck, which should translate to a 40 percent boost in graphics performance, according to Apple. All of this also comes to the larger 12.9-inch iPad Pro, making your choice more about size and price than performance or specs. The new Pro models will now support fast charging, USB 3 support and some new smart covers. The beginning models will start with 64 GB of memory, twice the amount the entry line had previously. There's a new 12MP camera (and a 7-megapixel FaceTime HD camera) with optical image stabilization and a high-speed sensor with a 1.8 apterture. The camera has a six-element lense, quad-LED True Tone Flash, wide color capture, and 4K video capture. Plus? iOS 11 has a plethora of new iPad-specific features. The new iPad Pro line starts at $649 for the 10.5-inch model (which is only $50 more than the previous 9.7-inch model), and only another $150 for the 12.9-inch iPad Pro's entry level device, which starts at at $799."}	\N

ARKit is Apple's new developer platform, allowing programmers to build apps that blend the real world with digital objects. It's due out later this year in iOS 11. ARKit supports Unity, Unreal and SceneKit -- opening up the worlds of AR game development and movie-making -- and it offers motion tracking, plus plane, lighting and scale estimations. Since ARKit will be available on iPads and iPhones, Apple CEO Tim Cook claims it will represent the world's largest AR platform. Compare it to Google Tango, for example: Google doesn't automatically include Tango on every Android device; instead, manufacturers must choose to include it. Wingnut AR, The Hobbit director Peter Jackson's company, demoed an ARKit game on-stage at Apple's WWDC event today. Creative Director Alasdair Coull held up an iPad Pro to a blank table and, on-screen, a living industrial village popped up, complete with townsfolk milling around and bombs dropping from planes. We also got a glimpse at an even more realistic version of Pokemon Go -- the OG AR app -- made possible via ARKit. ARKit exists thanks in large part to advances in artificial intelligence technology. Apple hasn't exactly been secretive about its focus on machine learning: Within the past year alone, the company published its first AI research paper, hired a Carnegie Mellon computer science professor, acquired the companies Turi and Lattice Data, and started building hardware specifically for AI. Almost exactly one year ago, during WWDC 2016, Apple teased how its own deep neural networks would improve the iPhone. Siri is a driving force behind Apple's AI push. Voice-activated assistants have found a hungry market, and major companies including Amazon and Google are working quickly to build the best, most natural digital personality. At this year's I/O conference, Google showcased its AI efforts, focusing on technology that would help Home, Android and other gadgets better understand human behavior and language. So far, Google's early investments in AI have paid off. Apple is hoping for similar results with its HomePod smart speaker, powered by Siri. The company revealed the Amazon Echo and Google Home competitor today, priced at $350 and due to hit stores in December. Apple is also using upgrades in computer learning to improve iOS, watchOS, macOS, tvOS and its Photos app. Robust AI tech is crucial to Apple's self-driving car plans, too."}	\N

It's yet another category where Apple is a bit late to the party -- Amazon's Echo and Alexa ecosystem has grown steadily over the past few years, and Google has also gotten a start with its Home speaker and Assistant. Even Microsoft has a leg up with the Cortana-powered Harman Kardon Invoke speaker. Apple's pitch, as usual, is that it's delivering a more premium audio experience than the competition. The HomePod's small, vase-like case houses a four-inch woofer and seven tweeters. It's powered by Apple's A8 processor, just like the iPhone. HomePod features \\"real-time acoustic modeling,\\" which allows it to tweak music to suit its environment. Apple is also targeting Sonos as a competitor, which is a sign that the HomePod's audio quality will be better than what we've seen from Amazon and Google. Of course, you can use the HomePod to access Siri with voice commands. But on this device, Siri is more than just a virtual assistant -- it's a \\"musicologist\\" that will help you find new tunes on Apple Music. You can also tell Siri you like a certain song, and it'll remember your tastes. What's most unique is that you'll be able to ask Siri specific questions like, \\"Who's the guitarist on this song?\\" HomePod is coming in December for $349, which is significantly more than the Amazon Echo, Google Home and Sonos's $300 Play:3. It'll be available in white and Apple's usual space grey. We're hoping to get some hands on time with it soon, so keep an eye out."}	\N
